## Beachblue

### The Idea

The idea behind Beachblue is to help everyone discover their favourite beach from the comfort of their own home. Planning for beach days made easy, or as we say: *Your next dip, right in one click!*

### The Gears

Under the hood our website combines [official EU data on waterquality](https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/data/bathing-water-directive-status-of-bathing-water-12) with [data from the Spanish government on beach amenities](https://opendata.esri.es/datasets/playas-espa%C3%B1olas/explore?location=35.487513%2C-6.807217%2C5.55) to inform the user about beaches around Spain. Our fancy machine learning models help us predict how well Google users would rate a spot and also make up our own rating system!

### The Beauty

From stunning Figma files, to a wepage as easy to navigate as child-play: It was a long journey but we are happy and insanely proud to present to you the final result: A working prototype of Beachblue!

Please follow the instructions below to run it:

- Open the beachblue - app folder
- Look for the index.html file (ideally, you have the Live Server extension in your Vs. Code)
- right-click and choose the option "Open With Server."
- Once opened, you will be on our home page.
