# The idea

The idea behind Beachblue is to help everyone discover their favorite beach from the comfort of their own home. Planning for beach days made easy, or as we say: *Your next dip, right in one click!*

Our website uses machine learning to rate bathing spots and helps you make a selection on where to go for a swim, all in a beautiful and easy to use environment. This article will detail our work that resulted in a fully functional prototype!

# Brainstorming

Before starting anything, we sat together and defined our goals and limits.

We began the session with a small task to see how the members are dealing with the project emotionally. At that point, we were the 6 of us on the project. Fortunately, no one was scared or tired and had a healthy motivation to work further on the project.

In the ideation phase we chose a name and slogan for the website, deifned our main values and target group. The main features were discussed as well as the personal goals and we talked about which function or feature were the most important for the members personally.

The last part was to decide what and when could be done. We had a rather complex table for setting up deadlines for us, but in the end, we decided to create a simple, numbered list of the priorities.

![Blog%20Post%202%200%20d8e08ce4e4e2443da1a09a532872a1d7/Screenshot_2021-07-03_at_09.23.46.png](Blog%20Post%202%200%20d8e08ce4e4e2443da1a09a532872a1d7/Screenshot_2021-07-03_at_09.23.46.png)

With this in mind the UX designers could start their work.

# UX Design

## User Research

The first step in the UX design process was to gather information about the needs of our target group. Within the user research stage, we conducted a user survey: 11 questions have been asked in total, 5 demographic and 6 habits related ones.

Mostly (89,1%) of the participants were located in Europe and had diverse range of education and professional background. 76,6% of them were in the age range of 25-34.

### Key Findings

1. The 2/3 of them decide about going to a beach based on the weather

    ![Blog%20Post%202%200%20d8e08ce4e4e2443da1a09a532872a1d7/Untitled.png](Blog%20Post%202%200%20d8e08ce4e4e2443da1a09a532872a1d7/Untitled.png)

2.  Half of them relies on friend recommendations, 35,9% checks forums or blogs. **No one visits specific websites.**

![Blog%20Post%202%200%20d8e08ce4e4e2443da1a09a532872a1d7/Untitled%201.png](Blog%20Post%202%200%20d8e08ce4e4e2443da1a09a532872a1d7/Untitled%201.png)

3. We received only one website address which is not Google: **blogto.com**

4. The top 3 needs: 

1. How long it takes to get to the beach 75% (48 people)
2. Less crowded 60,9% (39 people)
3. Facilities nearby 46,9% (30 people)

![Blog%20Post%202%200%20d8e08ce4e4e2443da1a09a532872a1d7/Untitled%202.png](Blog%20Post%202%200%20d8e08ce4e4e2443da1a09a532872a1d7/Untitled%202.png)

5. Participants don't use specific beach finder sites. This meant that our competitors (if there were any) are not super popular amongst them.

6. It is highly required to provide other info about the beach than only details about the water body, especially facilities nearby.

7. The map view would be quite popular, so we should put the most effort into this feature.

8. The idea of an open, editable website was popular, people are up for sharing their experience and reading the reviews left by others.

## User Personas

Based on the finding we built two user personas. This is a reat way to translate our target group's needs, and create the set of needs of one imaginative human being out of their goals.

We worked with Gregory (27) student and gym owner, a constant wanderer and Elena (33) IT project manager and lovely mom. We tried to include all the needs that we discovered during the research into their profile as personality description, needs, what they liked the most and what frustrated them.

![Blog%20Post%202%200%20d8e08ce4e4e2443da1a09a532872a1d7/Gregory.png](Blog%20Post%202%200%20d8e08ce4e4e2443da1a09a532872a1d7/Gregory.png)

![Blog%20Post%202%200%20d8e08ce4e4e2443da1a09a532872a1d7/Elena.png](Blog%20Post%202%200%20d8e08ce4e4e2443da1a09a532872a1d7/Elena.png)

### User Flow

From that point on we created and familiarised ourselves with them, translated their needs into a user flow, and tried to imagine how they used our beach finder website. We wanted to keep it simple as members of every path (DS, WD, UX) were students at that point, and we weren't completely sure which features' building process would fit the time frame we had ahead of us.

The main goal was to come up with a map and list view and to provide recommendations.The next step was to visualize the flow and came up with some ideas for the low-fidelity wireframes: 

![Blog%20Post%202%200%20d8e08ce4e4e2443da1a09a532872a1d7/UX_-_User_Flow_Through_Application.png](Blog%20Post%202%200%20d8e08ce4e4e2443da1a09a532872a1d7/UX_-_User_Flow_Through_Application.png)

### Wireframes

The next step was to visualize the flow and came up with some ideas for the low-fidelity wireframes:

![Blog%20Post%202%200%20d8e08ce4e4e2443da1a09a532872a1d7/UX-_Low-Fidelity_Wireframes.jpeg](Blog%20Post%202%200%20d8e08ce4e4e2443da1a09a532872a1d7/UX-_Low-Fidelity_Wireframes.jpeg)

Aftern this, our UX designer put these ideas into digital form. The tool we used was Figma during the whole process. It was not that easy to create the design as we still didn't know which areas would be covere by the data set. Therefore the sample countries were Span, Germany and France.

The most important thing before designing any wireframe was to create the building blocks out. We used Google Material Design componenets to keep the layout consistent. For this purpose, we created some primitive blocks for further use for more complex components. 

The components could be combined later on which were th basis for our Figma variables. All our main blocks were put on a single sheet to keep the artboard clean and organised. 

![Blog%20Post%202%200%20d8e08ce4e4e2443da1a09a532872a1d7/components.png](Blog%20Post%202%200%20d8e08ce4e4e2443da1a09a532872a1d7/components.png)

Then let's see what we build out of them:

![Blog%20Post%202%200%20d8e08ce4e4e2443da1a09a532872a1d7/Home_page.png](Blog%20Post%202%200%20d8e08ce4e4e2443da1a09a532872a1d7/Home_page.png)

Home page

On the home page we can use the big search bar displayed in the middle of the page for looking for exact places or areas, by typing their names in.

On this very same page we can find the acces to the recommendations (Our top picks), by using the button in the top right corner or taking a look at the cards close to the bottom.

## Usability Testing

Before moving on to work in the UI, we wanted to test our website. This way we saved time, because if we have done the visual work as well before testing and finding the weak points, we would have to work twice - restructuring the pages and applying the visuals again.

**We asked our participants to complete four tasks in the prototype:**

1.  1. Imagine that you want to see the options which beaches to go in/around Berlin. By using the website complete the action and check where you could go.
2. Imagine that you are satisfied with the search results, you check the list and then you want to see tall of them on the map at the same time where they are located exactly. Please discover the whole search result page for view options.
3. Imagine that you chose Strandbad Wannsee to go to, so you want to check out the details of this spot. Let's see what facilities are provided, and what others said about this place. In the end of checking the page, get directions to the place in Google Maps.
4. Imagine that you're interested in some new places to go for a holiday. Check the website if you can get inspiration where to go, without having to search for any exact spots.

Based on the answers we evaluated the findings and created a list of the main errors and issues. The evaluation contained what had to be refined immediately before the launch, what could wait and what were only cosmetic problems.

[Evaluation of results](https://www.notion.so/24c45e4a6b5d4598818bfe4b86372b97)

Then the design has been refined according to the findings, and then applied the UI design on the wireframes.

# Data Science

## Data Cleaning and Preparation

After our UX designer completed the user research we were instantly in trouble as it turns out that users wanted to know much more than just the water quality before deciding where to go for a beach day. However water quality was the only data we had.

We had to search for different data sets which had insights into the facilities of the spots that we were looking for. Fortunately, we found the Spanish dataset which had most of the facilities that the users were expecting from our user research. We decided to narrow down our scope to just Spain for the initial phase and later expand to different other locations across the EU. 

The next challenge we faced was when we realized that the locations in both datasets didn't match as seen in the figure below. But we worked our way out and figured out how to match the datasets and merge the columns that were necessary.

![Blog%20Post%202%200%20d8e08ce4e4e2443da1a09a532872a1d7/coordinates_comparison.png](Blog%20Post%202%200%20d8e08ce4e4e2443da1a09a532872a1d7/coordinates_comparison.png)

The biggest challenge we faced was to translate the entire data set from Spanish to English. We also found a lot of inconsistent data, which had to be cleaned before we could apply our machine learning models to get accurate results. We used most of the methods that we introduced to us during the learning phase to clean the data. 

## Machine Learning

Merging, cleaning and prepping our dataset took long enough but now we were ready to jump into machine learning fun! And instantly the question came up of what we actually want to predict. We did not have any kind of obvious target variable that we could predict so instead we tried our hand and clustering the beaches, hoping we would find some underlying similarities.

### Clustering (gone wrong!)

For the first clustering attempt we used a label encoder to turn all features into numerical values and then tried to cluster based on the most frequently appearing value in each observation. This is the [K-Modes](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/784206) algorithm. However it produced only two clusters, which were essentially meaningless to us:

![Blog%20Post%202%200%20d8e08ce4e4e2443da1a09a532872a1d7/kmodes.png](Blog%20Post%202%200%20d8e08ce4e4e2443da1a09a532872a1d7/kmodes.png)

Comparing computational cost against the number of clusters

Our second attempt was to use the TF-IDF algorithm which Netflix or news sites use to recommend similar movies/articles to you. However the algorithm is mainly good at finding common topics in texts and it seems our short descriptions of the spots were not long or unique enough to bring meaningful results. Perhaps we can use this algorithm on user reviews once we have enough of them. Another ~~failure~~ learning experience!

### Getting and Predicting Google ratings

By using the Google Places [API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/overview) we were able to retrieve the ratings of several spots based on their latitude and longitude. A word of caution: Be sure to use the API responsibly and do not scrape large amounts of data from Google, as this is a violation of their ToS and might get you banned. This method yielded us the ratings for only a few spots though. Not only because we did not want to really 'scrape' the API but also because the exact location of the beaches might be different in Google than in our data-set. You can set a certain radius in which to search but still a sizeable amount of beaches did not receive a rating (hidden gems, anyone?).
To fill in these missing values we split the data with ratings into a training and test set and trained various machine learning models on the training set to see which would result in the best output.

The best results where given by a Decision Tree Regressor. You may be familiar with a Decision Tree Classifier which sorts observations into different clusters. The Decision Tree Regressor works similarly but outputs a continuous value instead, in this case a rating between 0 and 5.


<img src="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/fa15ebb8-c292-45da-9619-5e31f52be70d/actual.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAT73L2G45O3KS52Y5%2F20210711%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20210711T175259Z&X-Amz-Expires=86400&X-Amz-Signature=ff2ce79ff69c5fe16e783b1ca96deb5e43b38dd64890b24f035efa222d9f7987&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&response-content-disposition=filename%20%3D%22actual.png%22" alt="The actual values of the test set" />

<img src="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/1bacb787-302a-41cd-8f1a-0de120adc59c/pred.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAT73L2G45O3KS52Y5%2F20210711%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20210711T174950Z&X-Amz-Expires=86400&X-Amz-Signature=bc8d4d949a1ac5cac77ba62d46722bcb1e7fc687c339d4404949c0467a54da44&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&response-content-disposition=filename%20%3D%22pred.png%22" alt="The actual values of the test set" />

Above you can see on top the actual values that our test set has and below the values our model predicted. Aside from the one outlier it seems to have done a decent job. In more scientific terms our model has a root mean squared error of 0.43 and in less scientific terms our model misses the actual rating by 0.43.

### Creating our own rating system

We already had the google ratings, but we wanted to give our users the best experience while they use our web app. So we wanted to recommend to them some places which had the best facilities that they were looking for. Hence, we came up with our own rating system where each facility had a weight or value assigned to it. Depending on those values the beaches were rated from 1-5. We also had implemented a machine learning model based on classification, which in the future would be able to classify the beaches from 1-5 based on the user's input if there are some additional facilities available on that spot. While testing our machine learning model we saw that we had the best-predicted score of 93% when the kNclassifier was set to 3. We also tested various other KNclassifier values to get the predicted score as shown in the figure below. 

![Blog%20Post%202%200%20d8e08ce4e4e2443da1a09a532872a1d7/Figure_2.png](Blog%20Post%202%200%20d8e08ce4e4e2443da1a09a532872a1d7/Figure_2.png)

Varying numbers of Neighbors to get the best accuracy 

With the K-NN value as 3, our prediction score was 93% and the MSE was 0.26. The below figure shows the difference between the Test set and the Train set values in histogram.

# Web Development

Tools & Programming languages used for Beachblue. 

HTML, CSS, SCSS, Javascript, Jquery, JSON, API Maps.

We used Notion, Slack and Zoom to keep us organised and discuss all the to dos. 

In our first meetings, it was decided to use React and Material UI to build our website. During the beginning of our project, we changed our mind and opted for a simpler variable based on what we learned in the academic phase and our main base was html, css and javascript.

The different components - beach cards, search result cards, search bar and navigation, among others - were developed separately and then combined into the different sections of our website

To implement the base of our project, and make it a little more dynamic and sophisticated, we used SASS and JQUERY. SASS was used as a pre-processor scripting language that will be compiled or interpreted into CSS, to complement our CSS code, making the process more practical to apply CSS on every page. JQUERY Javascript library was used to make the page more dynamic, especially when applying the page search filters.

The two of the languages above were not part of the learning package on Edyoucated, but we chose to study and implement them into Beachblue.

Javascript was used as a way of reading and manipulating the JSON object files generated by the data team, an object with more than 3k beaches located in Spain that need to be read, “cleaned” and filtered to later be presented in the frontend. Our biggest challenge was working with JSON objects creating filters for more than one field.

For our site's mapping work, we use Google's API mapping for the basic tile for location-aware apps, and visualization features. Due to the short time and lack of Backend in our project we were unable to work on features such as geocoding, directions and navigation, or touch screen interaction.

The images used on Beachblue, and used directly in our codes were collected from the Unsplash website, free of royalties and free to use.

Despite the lack of Backend in our project, we are happy with the final result delivered. And we believe that we got a good result, with an easy-to-use interface, and every effort we made was maximum to apply everything we learned and leave the final result exactly like the figma file delivered by our UX team.
