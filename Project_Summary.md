# Project: Beachblue

Beachblue is a website aiming to help everyone discover their favorite beach from the comfort of their own home. Planning for beach days made easy, or as we say:Â *Your next dip, right in one click!*

Beachblue allows you to browse thousands of beaches, filter many attributes based on your preferences, see the spots' machine generated ratings and the beach location on a map.

The Data Science team collected the data and created the machine learning models while the Web Development team created the back and frontend. The website was designed by our UX Designer.
